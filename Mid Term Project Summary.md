This is a **mid-term cloud computing project** worth 20% of the final grade in CSCI5409 Advanced Topics in Cloud Computing (Winter 2026).

## Core Concept

Students must build and deploy a **fully functional cloud application on AWS** to demonstrate their ability to learn and work with cloud services independently.

## Key Requirements

**AWS Service Selection** - Must choose at least one service from each category:

- **Compute** (e.g., EC2, Lambda, ECS)
- **Storage** (e.g., S3, EBS, EFS)
- **Networking** (e.g., API Gateway, CloudFront, VPC)
- **Database** (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB)

**Technical Constraints:**

- All code must be **original** (written specifically for this course)
- Infrastructure must use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- Everything must be **fully automated** - single-command deployment with no manual steps
- Must work within **AWS Academy Learner Lab** sandbox limitations

**Application Scope:**

- More than just "Hello World" - must have meaningful logic
- Can be any type: web app, API, mobile backend, IoT, GenAI application, etc.
- Address a real-world or well-defined hypothetical use case

## Deliverables

1. **Written Report (60%)** - Must include:
    
    - Project introduction and purpose
    - Service selection justification
    - Architecture diagram (using diagrams.net)
    - Security analysis
    - Cost analysis
    - Future development plans
2. **Video Presentation (15 min max, 40%)** - Must show:
    
    - Student ID at the start
    - Live demonstration of working application
    - Explanation of AWS services used
    - Full functionality showcase

**Bottom Line:** Build something real in the cloud, fully automated, and prove you understand cloud computing through both documentation and demonstration.
